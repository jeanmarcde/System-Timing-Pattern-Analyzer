# System-Timing-Pattern-Analyzer

This program does the following:

- Collects high-precision timestamps with nanosecond resolution
- Uses a simple busy-wait between samples to allow system state to naturally vary
- Calculates moving averages to smooth out noise
- Creates a visual representation of timing patterns
- Attempts to detect periodic patterns by looking at correlations

When you run this, you might see patterns that correspond to:

- System scheduler ticks
- Power management state changes
- Background process activity
- CPU thermal throttling

The visualization will show you the "shape" of these patterns, and the correlation analysis will try to identify how often they repeat.

This was built with the assumption that as timing resolution increases we may be able to identify or correlate the following;

- Temperature fluctuations
- Power supply variations
- System load patterns
- External electromagnetic interference
- Quantum effects at the semiconductor level
